In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating in real-time even though I was using the `.on('value', ...)` listener.  The issue stemmed from a combination of factors: asynchronous operations and improper data handling within the listener. My code was attempting to perform multiple asynchronous operations (database reads) within the listener, and the results weren't being processed in the correct order. Additionally, I had a small mistake in updating my data structure in the database causing the updates to be inconsistent.
